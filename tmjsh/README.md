## tmjsh
by Tahsin Ahmed, Michael Hu, and Jin cheng Zhang\
Team tmjsh

### Features:
- Forks and executes commands.
    - Allows change the working directory using cd.
    - You will never be stuck forever with the exit command!
- Parses multiple commands on a single line
- Can redirect with > and <.
- Allows for simple pipes with |.
- Engage user(s) with a colorful prompt
- Run tmjsh inside itself

---

### Attempted:
- These functionalities were tested but not considered complete (or was removed)
  - Generalized redirection (ordering of redirection not mattering)
    - Attempted through the creation of a general link struct over
    the specific functions that redirects in and out.
    - Tried to use a stack to store redirections but had difficult parsing it
  - Chain piping did not work

---

### Bugs:
- If you attempt to chain a redirection that has the same direction, the program assumes that you are redirecting to the entire latter part (e.g. ls > hi > there will result a redirection to "hi > there").
	- The same thing happens if you try to chain more than two redirections.
  - The same thing also happens if you try to pipe in the form of a > b < c.
	- If you do "hi < ls > bye," then the program makes a file ls
- If you try to cd into a directory that doesn't exist, it won't tell you that the directory doesn't exist.
- If you try to chain pipes, the program will tell you that the arguments are files that do not exist.
- Not all commands are usable (e.g. "repeat" doesn't work).

### Files & Function Headers:
#### parse.c
- Handles the parsing of commands
  ```
  /*======== char * trim_front() ==========
  Inputs:  char *str
  Returns: Pointer to first character in string str that
  is not a whitespace

  Removes leading whitespace on the string str
  ====================*/
  
  
  /*======== char * trim_back() ==========
  Inputs:  char *str
  Returns: Pointer to the beginning of the string (original
  pointer)

  Removes trailing whitespace on the string str and places
  a terminator at the end
  ====================*/


  /*======== char * trim() ==========
  Inputs:  char *str
  Returns: Pointer to first character on the string str that
  is not a whitespace

  Removes leading and trailing whitespace on the string str
  and places a terminator at the end
  ====================*/


  /*======== int num_args() ==========
  Inputs:  char *cmd
  Returns: Number of arguments in cmd separated by a whitespace

  Counts the number of times a whitespace appears in the string cmd.
  The number of argument is 1 more than the number of appearances.
  If a whitespace does not appear, 1 is returned.
  ====================*/
  
  
  /*======== char ** parse_args() ==========
  Inputs:  char *cmd
  Returns: Array of strings where each entry is an argument
  separated by a whitespace from the string cmd

  Uses trim() to trim cmd
  Uses num_args() to dynamically allocate memory for the returned array.
  If there are multiple arguments in cmd, this function will separate
  them into and put each argument into an array of strings
  ====================*/
  ```

### shell.c
- Handles prompt display and certain shell functions like redirection and piping
  ```
    /*======== char * replace() ==========
    Inputs: char *str
            char *p1
            char *p2
    Returns: A string in which occurrences of string p1 are replaced by
    string p2

    Uses different string functions to find the occurences of string p1 in 
    the string str, then concatenating a version of string str in which p1
    is replaced by p2 
    ====================*/


    /*======== char * expand_path() ==========
    Inputs:  char *path
    Returns: A string of the full path

    Uses replace() to replace the tilda with the 
    full name of the initial working directory of the user
    ====================*/


    /*======== char * shorten_path() ==========
    Inputs:  char *path
    Returns: A string of the shortened path of the string path 

    Uses replace() to replace the full name of the initial 
    working directory to a tilda
    ====================*/


    /*======== char * get_last_dir() ==========
    Inputs:  char *path
    Returns: The last directory in the path

    This allows so that the prompt always show the last part
    of the CWD
    ====================*/

    
    /*======== char * get_prompt() ==========
    Inputs:  char *colors[6]
    Returns: The prompt with the user, host, and directory

    Gets and returns the prompt
    ====================*/


    /*======== int redirect_out() ==========
    Inputs:  char *cmd
    Returns: A save of the file descriptor of STDOUT

    Sets up the redirection stream for "<" by using dup2()  
    to refer to the redirected file
    ====================*/
    
    
    /*======== int redirect_in() ==========
    Inputs:  char *cmd
    Returns: A save of the file descriptor of STDIN

    Sets up the redirection stream for ">" by using dup2()
    to refer to the redirected file
    ====================*/
    
    
    /*======== int exec_pipe() ==========
    Inputs:  char ** cmd
    Returns: A save of the file descriptor of STDIN

    Executes piping if the command contains a pipe
    ====================*/
    ```

### main.c
- Handles the reading, forking, and execution of commands
- Also implements the features of the other file including parsing, piping, and redirecting

### color.h
- Makes for a better stylistic prompt
- Adapted from Tahsin's favorite Youtuber's bash prompt
